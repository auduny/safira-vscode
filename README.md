## More about Safira

A simple and elegant theme, featuring a dark blue UI with carefully chosen easy on the eyes syntax colors that provide optimal contrast, clarity, and focus. The [Safira Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yinz.safira) is compatible with VSCode 1.67.0+.

"Safira" is the term used to refer to the precious gemstone sapphire üíé in my home country `Brazil`. I was thinking of a name for the theme, and this immediately came to mind when I thought about anything blue. There's no other specific reason.
